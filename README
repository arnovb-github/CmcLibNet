CmcLibNet is a .Net wrapper around the Commence API designed to make working with Commence from a .Net language easier. My primary motive for developing it was to make talking to Commence from PowerShell easier. PowerShell will allow you to talk to Commence as a COM object, but you have to use the nasty IDispatch interface.

You can talk to Commence in a 'normal' COM way from any COM-capable language (except Powershell) - but it quickly gets tedious. CmcLibNet intends to alleviate some of that. It completely hides the DDE interface which Commence has sneakily implemented as ICommenceConversation (which is really just a proxy for DDE calls), and it adds some functionality to speed up things. Exporting data from Commence can be a bit of a bitch, as is querying the database. CmcLibNet makes that a little easier.

The assembly is COM-enabled, which why some of the code is rather complex.

I am not a professional programmer. This was one of first ever C# projects. I learn (and forget) as I go along, but I know my talent is not in coding.
