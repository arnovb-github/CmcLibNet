Building the spec:
nuget spec

Packaging the spec


Include the dependencies in the nuspec file manually or they will not be pulled in when installing package.

create the nupkg, note the inclusion of the packages directory (because they are 1 path below working directory)
nuget pack .\CmcLibNet.csproj -PackagesDirectory ..\packages\ 

or simply

nuget pack -packagesdirectory ..\packages -Properties Configuration=Release

Note that the -Properties part must come last!

Pushing to NuGet:

nuget push .\Vovin.CmcLibNet.X.Y.Z.nupkg -ApiKey <apikey> -Source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json

(optional: update the -ignoredepedencies documentation on the nuget website)
